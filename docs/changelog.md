# Changelog

All notable changes to the YouTube Hide Watched Video Extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.4.4] - 2025-09-19

### Fixed
- Migrated individually hidden video storage to `chrome.storage.local` to eliminate the previous ~62 item cap caused by sync storage quotas.
- Added automatic migration and metadata normalization for legacy hidden video records in both content script and Hidden Videos Manager.
- Expanded automated coverage to verify large-volume hidden video persistence and regression scenarios.

## [2.4.3] - 2025-09-05

### Fixed
- Packaged build now includes the Hidden Videos Manager page files (`hidden-videos.html`, `hidden-videos.css`, `hidden-videos.js`). This resolves `ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` when clicking “View Hidden Videos”.
- Updated `scripts/build-extension.sh` to copy the Hidden Videos Manager assets into the build directory and ZIP package.

## [2.4.2] - 2025-01-27

### Changed
- Modified dropdown behavior for Watched Videos and Shorts sections - dropdowns now only open via the collapse button (">") instead of clicking anywhere on the header
- Improved UX by making the interaction more explicit and preventing accidental toggles
- Updated section header cursor from pointer to default to better indicate clickable areas
- Enhanced collapse button hover state with subtle border for better visual feedback

## [2.4.1] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed
- Fixed UI latency issue in popup interface where mode selection buttons had delayed visual feedback
